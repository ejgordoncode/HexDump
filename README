// Project: Simple Hexdump Program (Assignment 1)
// Class: CS530

// About Me
//     Hello! I am a third-year Computer Science major. I used this assignment as a refresher in c and c++.
// Project Overview
//     This is a simple hexdump program that reads text files and outputs information about the contents of
//     the file in terms of addresses, hexadecimal values, and ASCII characters. It takes up to three arguments 
//     in the command line:
//         Format 1: ./xed <inputFile.txt>
//              This is the default mode for the program. It will process 16 bytes at a time. First, it will output 
//              the address of the first byte in the group. Then it will output the hexadecimal values of every 2
//              bytes, separated by one space each, so there are 8 groups of 2 bytes. Lastly, it will convert
//              the hexadecimal values into their ASCII character representation. If it encounters a non-printable 
//              character, that character is represented as a '.' instead.
//         Format 2: ./xed -b <inputFile.txt>
//              The argument "-b" signals to the program that its output must be in binary format. It will
//              process 6 bytes at a time. First, it will output the address of the first byte of the group.
//              Then, it will process 6 bytes of text and output them as 8-digit binary numbers separated
//              by one space each. Lastly, it will convert the binary values into their ASCII character representation.
//              If it encounters a non-printable character, that character is represented as a '.' instead.
// Compilation and Execution
//      To compile this program, follow these steps on the Edoras remote server: (or plain cmd line if not an SDSU student)
//          1. make clean
//          2. make
//          3. ./xed <inputFile.txt> OR ./xed -b <inputFile.txt>
//      Here is an example:
//          echo "Hello, world!" > helloWorld.txt
//          ./xed helloWorld.txt
//              000000: 4865 6c6c 6f2c 2077 6f72 6c64 21  Hello, world!
//          ./xed -b helloWorld.txt
//              000000: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100  Hello,
//              000006: 00100000 01110111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100   world
//              00000c: 00100001  !
